# Usability annotations

1. in the menu section you can see 2 menu bars and should only be one with the quick actions on the right side and the most relevant links on the left side

2. there is no way for the user to look over and know were is he, interface or section, there is no breadcrum or highlight menu that indicate this information

3. exist texts in different languages (spanish and english), and not all users can understand both languages so it reduces the accessibility to the page

4. at the carousel, seems 3 dots that indicate the position, and it 's only relevant at the beginning and the end, becouse there is no number or reference that indiquetes in what position he is and how many are

5. the button to top is only at the end of the page and delimited with a non conflitted zone, in all the page in that right position there is no elements

6. in the pricing section, a comparative table brings more menningful information.

7. if the app bar scrolls with the app, then should have a more distintive color or a shadow that let the user identify were the appBar ends and the content begins

8. in the carousel/slider some items have a text over a image, in some cases this is bad because text loses legibility

9. the only button that the user can highlight is the login button

10. at the end there are items that seems to be at top of the background but there is no shadows in all the page

11. there are 3 outlined / stroked texts that seems to be buttons but have no actions

12. no divider between contents sections, make the user effort to differ the section  contents (begin and end)
